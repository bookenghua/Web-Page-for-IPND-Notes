[IPND] Stage 1: Make a Web Page

## Stage 1 Details
In this stage, I used HTML and CSS to structure and beautify notes about the new concepts and skills I've learned so far.

## Stage 1 Rubric Objectives

### Code Review

#### Use of Syntax
- HTML and `CSS` files pass an automated validation check

#### Logical `HTML` Structure
- Conceptually related content is contained within a container element (`<span>` or `<div>` for example)

#### `HTML` Classes
- Related container elements have the same class name

#### `CSS` Styling
- Class names are used in the `CSS` to style related elements

#### Use of `HTML` Tags
- Page uses tags appropriately `(<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` for first header, etc.)
